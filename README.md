# Flashlight App 🔦

A simple flashlight mobile app developed in **Kotlin** using **Jetpack Compose**, **Camera2 API**, and **Voyager navigation**. This app was built as an experimental utility to support development and testing for **Code Cam**, an application that uses a smartphone's flashlight to transmit encoded light signals.

## 📱 Features

- Toggle flashlight on and off with a single tap
- Built with modern Android development practices
- Lightweight and minimal UI
- Serves as a companion tool for testing light-based communication in [Code Cam](https://github.com/kushbhati/CodeCam)
## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Kotlin** — Modern, concise, and expressive language for Android development
- **Jetpack Compose** — Declarative UI toolkit for building native UIs
- **Camera2 API** — Direct control over device camera and flashlight hardware
- **Voyager** — A lightweight navigation library for Compose

## 🚧 Purpose

This app was primarily created as a **testing utility** during the development of [Code Cam](https://github.com/kushbhati/CodeCam) — an app that sends data via flashlight pulses. This standalone flashlight app made it easier to test hardware behavior, camera access permissions, and performance under rapid on/off cycles.
